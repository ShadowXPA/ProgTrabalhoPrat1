# Programming

This subject focused on developing applications with the **C** programming language.

## Assignment

This subject had one assignment.

The [assignment](Assignment.pdf) was to develop a program that simulates the spreading of a virus in a population. The simulation does not reflect the real world, it is a very simplified simulation.  
The assignment had an extra functionality added which was the possibility to `go back X iterations`.  
This repository contains an extra program `LocalMaker` to create new binary files needed for the simulation. This was not part of the assignment.
